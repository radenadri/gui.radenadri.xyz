I’ve been working on the field for almost 3 years, currently i’ve got a lot of interest to website and also mobile apps technologies.

Sometimes i’m dealing with frontend, and sometimes i’m doing a little bit of technical things too. I love to make things up and running. Sounds like a full stack developer yup? (of course there’s so many things to learn).

My purpose to stay at this field because there something that makes me happy when i can help people through my work.

Currently i’m working as a Full Stack Developer at [Pentacode](https://pentacode.id).
